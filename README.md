## System Requirements

- Windows 10 or later (x64, x86, and ARM64)

## Development Requirements

To build this project, you need to install the following tools:

- **Visual Studio 2026** (or newer) with the "Desktop development with C++" workload. Ensure you select the following individual components:
    - MSVC v145 - VS 2026 C++ x64/x86 build tools
    - MSVC v145 - VS 2026 C++ ARM64 build tools
    - Windows SDK (latest version recommended)
- **CMake** (included in Visual Studio or installed standalone)
- **clang-format** (required for source formatting). You can install it either via Visual Studio C++ Clang tools or via standalone LLVM.
- **WiX Toolset** (v7.0 or newer) - Required for building the `.msi` installer. Ensure the WiX binaries are added to your system `PATH`.

### Quick Installation via Winget

You can quickly install the base tools using Windows Package Manager (`winget`):

```powershell
# Install Windows Terminal (Built-in on Win11, recommended for Win10)
winget install Microsoft.WindowsTerminal

# Install Visual Studio 2026 Community
winget install Microsoft.VisualStudio.2026.Community

# Install CMake
winget install Kitware.CMake

# Install LLVM (includes clang-format for code formatting. Optional.)
winget install LLVM.LLVM

# Install WiX Toolset
winget install wixtoolset.wix

# Accept WiX v7 EULA (required for build)
wix eula accept wix7

# Install the WiX extensions required by installer/installer.wxs
wix extension add -g WixToolset.UI.wixext/7.0.0
wix extension add -g WixToolset.Util.wixext/7.0.0
```

Verify `clang-format` is available:

```powershell
where clang-format
clang-format --version
```

*Note: After installing Visual Studio via `winget`, you must open the Visual Studio Installer to manually select the "Desktop development with C++" workload and the specific ARM64 build tools.*

## Repository Structure

- `src/`: The core source code of the project.
    - `src/Client/`: The TSF TIP (Text Input Processor) DLL. This is the component loaded by host applications (like Notepad).
    - `src/Server/`: The background engine process. Handles key processing, candidate generation, state management, and the custom candidate/tooltip popup windows.
    - `src/ConfigApp/`: The standalone configuration utility.
    - `src/Common/`: Shared logic used by multiple components (IPC, path utilities, etc.).
- `data/`: Runtime data files, including the language model (`data.txt`), dictionary service definitions, and bopomofo variants.
- `installer/`: Source files for the MSI installer, including WiX definitions and localization strings (`.wxl`).
- `docs/`: Technical documentation and guidelines (translated to English).
- `scripts/`: Internal PowerShell and VBScript utilities for installation, uninstallation, and process management.
- `tests/`: Unit tests and regression tests.
- `third_party/`: External libraries including OpenCC.

## Getting Started with Development

### 1. Setup Environment

Ensure all [Requirements](#development-requirements) are met. Run the `winget` commands to install the base tools and accept the WiX EULA.

### 2. Build and Install Locally

For day-to-day development, use the `install.ps1` script to build all architectures and install them to a local `dist/` folder. **Note: This script requires Administrator privileges.**

Note: In an elevated PowerShell terminal:

```powershell
.\install.ps1
```

This script will:

- Stop any running `McBopomofoServer` or `McBopomofoConfig` instances.
- Compile the code for x64, x86, and ARM64.
- Copy all binaries and data to the `dist/` directory.
- Register the TSF DLLs and start the server process.

### 3. Debugging

- **Tracing Logs**: The server runs in the background. To see what's happening in real-time, use the log tracer:

  ```powershell
  Get-Content -Path $env:TEMP\mcbopomofo_server.log -Wait -Tail 20
  ```

- **Settings**: You can trigger the settings app from the language bar menu or by running `dist\McBopomofoConfig.exe`.
- **Iterative Workflow**: After making code changes, simply run `.\install.ps1` again to rebuild and re-register the components.

### 4. Building the Installer

To generate the final MSI installer, run:

```powershell
.\build_msi.ps1
```

The output will be located in `dist/Win-McBopomofo-Installer.msi`.

The installer build uses WiX v7 with these extensions:

- `WixToolset.UI.wixext/7.0.0`
- `WixToolset.Util.wixext/7.0.0`

`build_msi.ps1` installs the extensions automatically, but WiX v7 still requires the EULA to be accepted once per user before the extension cache can be used:

```powershell
wix eula accept wix7
```

## Core Concept and Design Philosophy

Win-McBopomofo is a **state-driven** input method. The system is designed as a pipeline that transforms raw user input into a visual representation through clearly defined states.

The data flow follows this sequence:

1. **Windows Virtual Key**: The OS sends a raw key event (VK code) to the Client DLL.
2. **Abstract Key + State**: The Client maps the VK code to an internal `Key` structure and sends it to the Server. The Server combines this key with the current `InputState`.
3. **New State**: The `KeyHandler` logic processes the input and produces a **new logical state** (e.g., transitioning from `Empty` to `Inputting`, or `Inputting` to `ChoosingCandidate`).
4. **New UI State**: The Server projects this internal logical state into a `StateUpdatePayload` (UI state), which is a simplified representation designed for display.
5. **UI**: The Client receives the payload and applies TSF composition/commit updates inside the host process. For candidate UI, the Client first publishes data through the TSF UIElement path; when a custom popup is needed, it sends layout data to the Server, and the Server renders and positions the Candidate Window and Tooltip Window.

This architecture decouples the complex Windows TSF/Win32 APIs from the core input method logic, making the system easier to test, debug, and extend.

### Extending the Input Method

To add new features or input modes (like the current Big5 or Iroha modes), you should design and implement new states. The typical workflow is:

1. **Update `InputState.h`**: Define a new struct that inherits from `InputState` (or `NotEmpty` if it has a composing buffer).
2. **Update `KeyHandler`**: Implement the logic to enter this new state via the `stateCallback`. Add logic in `KeyHandler::handle` (or a specific handler method) to process keys while in this state.
3. **Update `InputController`**: Update `buildStateUpdatePayload_` to project your new logical state into the appropriate UI state (composition, candidates, tooltips, etc.) for the Client and Server UI pipeline to apply.

## Vocabulary and Language Model

The vocabulary and language model data for Win-McBopomofo are derived from the [upstream macOS McBopomofo project](https://github.com/openvanilla/McBopomofo).

**Please report any issues regarding vocabulary, word frequencies, or bopomofo readings to the macOS version's repository.**

Because the data tables are shared across platforms, if you plan to implement new features related to data tables or language models, it is highly recommended to develop them in the macOS version first and then port them to other platforms.

## Coding Style

This project follows a consistent coding style enforced by `clang-format`.

- **Configuration**: See `.clang-format` in the root directory.
- **Requirement**: Please ensure your code is formatted correctly before sharing or maintaining your own fork.
- **Formatting Command**:

  ```powershell
  # Format all C++ files in the src directory
  Get-ChildItem -Path src -Include *.cpp,*.h -Recurse | ForEach-Object { clang-format -i $_.FullName }
  ```

### Git Commit Convention

This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/).

- **Format**: `<type>(optional scope): <description>`
- **Common Types**:
    - `feat`: A new feature
    - `fix`: A bug fix
    - `docs`: Documentation only changes
    - `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, etc.)
    - `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
    - `chore`: Updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc.

## Common Scripts

- `install.ps1`: developer-oriented build and local staging flow
- `build_msi.ps1`: build the MSI installer
- `scripts/setup.ps1`: install a staged build to a target directory
- `scripts/uninstall.ps1`: unregister and remove an installed build

See [scripts/README.md](scripts/README.md) for script details.

## Basic Build

Example:

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build_verify -A x64
cmake --build build_verify --config Release
```

Important outputs are usually placed under:

- `build_verify/bin/Release/`
- `dist/`

## Notes

- The project uses Windows TSF and includes both TIP client and background server components.
- Some install and registration flows require Administrator privileges.

## Windows Compatibility

- **Supported OS**: Windows 10 and later (x64, x86, and ARM64).
- **Installer policy**: The MSI installer is configured to block installation on versions older than Windows 10.
- **Note**: While the core logic uses standard Win32 and TSF APIs, older versions (like Windows 7 or 8) are not supported and may experience issues with high-DPI scaling, modern UI themes, or TSF host integration.

## Misc

### Registry Verification

You can use the following commands in PowerShell to verify the installation and registration:

- **Get the installed DLL path (COM Registration):**

  ```powershell
  reg query "HKCR\CLSID\{8C9D652A-9B99-4B77-BA9A-3B0F76923B7B}\InProcServer32" /ve
  ```

- **Verify TSF Language Profile (Traditional Chinese):**

  ```powershell
  reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CTF\TIP\{8C9D652A-9B99-4B77-BA9A-3B0F76923B7B}\LanguageProfile\0x0404\{A3668853-2ED4-4D4B-A951-DE1C8B4C0A29}"
  ```

- **Check Server Autorun Entry:**

  ```powershell
  reg query "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run" /v "Win-McBopomofo-Server"
  ```

- **Verify TIP Categories (Immersive Support, etc.):**

  ```powershell
  reg query "HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\CTF\TIP\{8C9D652A-9B99-4B77-BA9A-3B0F76923B7B}\Category\Category\{534C48C1-063E-406F-8F50-F77617E46C9C}\{8C9D652A-9B99-4B77-BA9A-3B0F76923B7B}"
  ```
